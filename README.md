In this lab1, i finally finished 3 parts.

#The first one is calculating in Jupyter Notebook. I assigned the variables w, x, y, and z to the values (1, 11, 121,
1331), respectively and got all the final values:
The value x+y is 132
The sum of w and z is 1332
The average of the 4 values (using addition and dividing by 4) is 366.0
The difference between z and y is 1210
The quotient of z and x is 121.0
The product of w, x, y, and z is 1771561
The sum of a, b, and c is 1772892.0

#In the second part, i used Def() function in pycharm:

'''
def method1(name):
    print("Hi", name)

method1("Kate")
method1("Tom")
method1("Jerry")
'''

By testing, the outcomes are 
Hi Kate
Hi Tom
Hi Jerry

It is one successful project.

In the third part, i used the github web submitted all the assignments and wrote this outcome explaination
